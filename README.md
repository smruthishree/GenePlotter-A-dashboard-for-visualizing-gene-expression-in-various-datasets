Introduction
GeneBrew is designed to automate the exploration of gene expression data. It offers an intuitive and interactive interface for users to filter and visualize gene expression patterns based on different genes and diagnostic categories. The application supports two datasets from our research: IBD Biopsies RNA-Seq dataset and the Cambridge dataset.

Features
Dataset Selection: Choose between the IBD Biopsies RNA-Seq dataset and the Cambridge dataset.
Gene Selection: Select a gene of interest from the available options.
Diagnosis Filtering: Filter the data by selecting one or more diagnostic categories. For example: Ctrl, Crohn's disease (CD), Ulcerative colitis (UC).
Data Table: View the selected gene's expression data in a tabular format.
Visualization: Visualize gene expression patterns through box plots and point plots.
Statistical Analysis: View statistical comparisons between diagnostic categories.
Download: Download selected data, plots, and visualizations.
